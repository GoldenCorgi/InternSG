## Installation

Download Python3.6 or above

Download and run the python file, get the csv in the same folder.

You'll need certain libraries like beautifulsoup4. Just pip install them. 

## Features

Get a CSV of 1000 underpaying internships. Why? I have no idea.

## Contributing

Do a Pull Request if you wish to update either the csv or the py file.

I apologise greatly for the minimal documentation. Mostly self-documenting since its Python, but if there's any confusion feel free to contact me, if I haven't starved from underpaid internships.

## FAQ

- **Can I use this for myself?**
    - If you seriously need a csv of underpaying ($600, seriously, NS pays higher) jobs in Singapore, I'm more than willing to help. This is so sad alexa buy me a BTO.
- **There's alot of "fail" printing out in the python file. Is this normal?**
    - Short Answer: Yes, ignore it. The fail is when beautifulsoup is parsing through the div children and extracting the text out. Sometimes it fails because we can't have good things, like **decent pay** in internships.
- **Can I use this on other websites?**
    - Short Answer: No. Almost everyt website is made differently, either with Wordpress/Reactjs/GatsbyJS/Wix etc etc. It can be static or dynamic, it can have endless list or paged lists. Every program needs to be tailored to each website.
    - Shorter Answer: Hire me
